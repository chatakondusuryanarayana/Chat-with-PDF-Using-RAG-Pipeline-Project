# Chat-with-PDF-Using-RAG-Pipeline-Project

# 1. Overview
Imagine having a large PDF document and instantly getting answers to your questions without manually searching through pages. In this project, Iâ€™ve built an RAG pipeline that allows you to upload or fetch a PDF, ask a question about its content, and receive an accurate response. This system combines advanced Natural Language Processing techniques and tools like Hugging Face models, FAISS, and Sentence Transformers.


# 2. Architecture & Tools 

 1. PDF Retrieval: We use the requests library to download the PDF file from a provided URL.
 2. Text Extraction: PyMuPDF extracts textual data from the PDF. It supports multi-page PDFs and outputs clean text.
 3. Text Chunking: Since handling an entire document at once is inefficient, I split the text into smaller, manageable chunks of about 500 words each. This ensures both better embeddings and accurate query     
                   matching.
 4. Embedding Generation: Using the SentenceTransformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2), I convert the text chunks into vector embeddings. These embeddings are numerical representations of text.
 5. Similarity Search with FAISS: The embeddings are stored in a FAISS index (a library for fast similarity search). When the user asks a question, the query is converted into an embedding, and the most relevant 
                                   text chunks are retrieved based on similarity.
 6.Response Generation: Finally, the T5-small model from Hugging Face takes the retrieved text chunks and the user query as input, then generates a concise, relevant answer.
